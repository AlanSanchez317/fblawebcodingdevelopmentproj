  <p>Depending on the site, weekend shifts typically start Friday evening, are any time on Saturday, and are until Sunday evening local time. If a weekend shift is available at your site, you have the option to add it to your normal, weekly schedule. In addition to avoiding crowds and earning more pay, there are some great perks to working when most other people have time off.</p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li> - More pay – Most of these shifts pay more per hour, and this adds up as time goes on.</li>
    <li> - Get an education – Attend classes during weekday hours, as opposed to losing sleep with night classes or late studying.</li>
    <li> - Family events – Make your weekdays available to volunteer, attend your child’s school events, go to doctor appointments, or coach a local sports team.</li>
    <li> - Shorter commute time – Trade in the weekday traffic battle and get more time back for yourself.</li>
    <li> - Beat the weekend crowds – Free up weekdays at your leisure — many movie theaters, museums, and parks also offer discounts during the week.</li>
    <li> - Create more hours for yourself – You will have more hours in the week to pursue you interests, passions, or a side gig.</li>
  </ul>
